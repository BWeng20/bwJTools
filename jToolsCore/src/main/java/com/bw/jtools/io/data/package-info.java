/**
 * Package contain a serialisation framework for hierarchical data.<br>
 * Main feature of this package is the encapsulation of all parts in the data, so that they
 * can be generically handled. This enables version tolerant storage of data.
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>All fields owns an id. So order is not important. Unknown fields can be skipped.
 * <li>All fields have type-formation, size and encoding for on field is always known.</li>
 * <li>On top of the base protocol a class-serializer can store class information and can generically
 *     store objects - this functionality is limited to plain objects and will handle only public accessible fields but no
 *     property-like getter/setter.</li>
 * <li>The protocol is designed to produce small output, using a platform independent binary representations.</li>
 * </ul>
